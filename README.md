# Stumble
Mobile tap timing game where players must eradicate blocks while avoiding various penalties. The game includes a shop system where players can purchase a range of skins that alter game aesthetics, including themes, particle effects, and backgrounds. The game introduces an intriguing game-over condition, in which the game ends if the player's block size becomes less than the opposing block, adding another layer of challenge.
